The comput er currently picks a square at random. That's not very interesting. 

Let's make the computer defensive minded, so that if there's an immediate threat, then it will defend the 3rd square. 

We'll consider an "immediate threat" to be 2 squares marked by the opponent in a row. 

If there's no immediate threat, then it will just pick a random square.

x does always go first

if i go first, i use x
if you go first you use x

make the order of x o a constant
["X", "O"]

who is x

who goes first
who wants to be x
assign who to X and who to O

player is not prompted to choose who goes first, the constant is
