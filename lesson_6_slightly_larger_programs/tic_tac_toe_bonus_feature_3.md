The comput er currently picks a square at random. That's not very interesting. 

Let's make the computer defensive minded, so that if there's an immediate threat, then it will defend the 3rd square. 

We'll consider an "immediate threat" to be 2 squares marked by the opponent in a row. 

If there's no immediate threat, then it will just pick a random square.

x does always go first

if i go first, i use x
if you go first you use x

make the order of x o a constant
["X", "O"]

who is x

who goes first
who wants to be x
assign who to X and who to O

player is not prompted to choose who goes first, the constant is

3. Add one to the branch count for each function call or class method call.

4. Add one to the branch count for each occurrence of the new operator.

5. Add one to the condition count for each use of a conditional operator:

Assignment -- an explicit transfer of data into a variable,

Branch 
-- an explicit forward program branch out of scope 
-- a function call, class method call, or new operator

Condition 
-- a logical/Boolean test == != <= >= < > else case default try catch ? and unary conditionals.

treats it as an if/elsif/elsif... and lets all the when nodes count. In contrast to the CyclomaticComplexity cop, this cop considers else nodes as adding complexity.
