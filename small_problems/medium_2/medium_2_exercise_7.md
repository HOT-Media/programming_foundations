Write a method that returns the number of Friday the 13ths in the year given by an argument.

You may assume that the year is greater than 1752 (when the United Kingdom adopted the modern Gregorian Calendar) and that it will remain in use for the foreseeable future.

Examples:
```ruby
friday_13th(2015) == 3
friday_13th(1986) == 1
friday_13th(2019) == 2

Do not try to rewrite the calendar and the logic behind it

research google for the pattern

code the pattern

  how to determine the occurrences of friday the 13ths in a given year
  starting with 1752?

  Friday the 13th Patterns Repeat in the Calendar. 

  There is a calendrical method to the madness of Friday the 13th. 

  Whenever a common year begins on a Thursday, 

  the months of February, March, and November will have a Friday the 13th. This will happen 11 times in the 21st century.

A common year is a standard Gregorian calendar year with 365 days divided into 12 months, and only 28 days in February.

  
here is a calendrical method to the madness of Friday the 13th. Whenever a common year begins on a Thursday, the months of February, March, and November will have a Friday the 13th. This will happen 11 times in the 21st century.

The February-March-November pattern repeats in a 28-year cycle. In the 21st century, the cycle began in 2009. In 2015, 6 years later, Friday the 13th occurred in February, March, and November. This won't happen for 11 more years until 2026 and we'll have to wait again for 11 years until 2037 to see the February, March, and November trilogy.

This pattern will repeat itself starting 2043, 6 years after 2037.

There can be as many as three Friday the 13ths in a single calendar year; either in February, March and November in a common year starting on Thursday (such as 2009, 2015 or 2026) (D), or January, April and July in a leap year starting on Sunday (such as 2012) (AG).



 how many friday the 13ths were in 1752
 calculate 1 cycle of friday the 13ths to make sure the logic works out before going any further

  is it a leap year?
  if leap year,
