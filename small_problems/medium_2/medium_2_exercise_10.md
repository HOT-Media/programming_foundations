Write a method that computes the difference between the square of the sum of the first n positive integers and the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers.

Examples:
```ruby
sum_square_difference(3) == 22
   # -> (1 + 2 + 3)**2 - (1**2 + 2**2 + 3**2)
sum_square_difference(10) == 2640
sum_square_difference(1) == 0
sum_square_difference(100) == 25164150


```
According to an anecdote, the math genius Carl Friedrich Gauss, added all the numbers from 1 through 100 when he was at a very young age. The sum of the first positive 100 integers is 5050 and Gauss was able to give this sum in less than a minute. True or not, how can we get the sum of all these numbers with admirable speed? Well, itâ€™s not really that hard
```ruby
sum_square_difference(3) == 22
   # -> (1 + 2 + 3)**2 - (1**2 + 2**2 + 3**2)
