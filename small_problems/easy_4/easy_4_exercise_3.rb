In the modern era under the Gregorian Calendar, 
leap years occur in every year that is evenly divisible by 4, 
unless the year is also divisible by 100. If the year 
is evenly divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year unless the 
year is evenly divisible by 400.

Assume this rule is good for any year greater than year 0. 
Write a method that takes any year greater than 0 as input, 
and returns true if the year is a leap year, or false if it is not a leap year.




rules

years evenly diveded by 4 are leap years, % = 0

years divided by 4 and 100 are not leap years % != 0

years divided by 4, and 100, and 400 are leap years % = 0


if its not divisible by 4 its not even a candidate for a leap year

  2 types of numbers
  1, diviisble by 4, 2, not divisible by 4

  then there are 2 types of numbers
  1 divisible by 4, 100, and 400   and 4 and 100


year = 100
year = 16

if year % 4  == 0  && year % 100 == 0 && year % 400 == 0
  true

if true and true || false

  if







when 
a = 5
=> 5
   answer = case a
   when 5  
     "a is 5"  
   when 6  
     "a is 6"  
   else  
     "a is not 6"
   end  
=> "a is 5"
   
   p answer
"a is 5"
=> "a is 5"
