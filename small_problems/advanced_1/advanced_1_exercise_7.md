Write a method that takes two sorted Arrays as arguments, and returns a new Array that contains all elements from both arguments in sorted order.

You may not provide any solution that requires you to sort the result array. You must build the result array one element at a time in the proper order.

Your solution should not mutate the input arrays.

Examples:
```ruby
merge([1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 8]) == [1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9]
merge([1, 1, 3], [2, 2]) == [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
merge([], [1, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
merge([1, 4, 5], []) == [1, 4, 5]

[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 8]



identify the value of each element of each array

iterate through both arrays
find the lowest number and save it 

1 less than 5,9,2,6,8

first element of result array

merge(arr1,arr2)
