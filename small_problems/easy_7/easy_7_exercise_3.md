Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new string that contains the original value of the argument with the first character of every word capitalized and all other letters lowercase.

You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

Examples
```ruby
word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'


*************************************************JMX
def word_cap(str)
  str.split(" ").map {|idx| idx.capitalize }.join(" ")
end

p word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
p word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
p word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'

*************************************************LS 


def word_cap(words)
  words_array = words.split.map do |word|
    word.capitalize
  end
  words_array.join(' ')
end
