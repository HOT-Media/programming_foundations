In the previous exercise, we developed a procedural method for computing the value of the nth Fibonacci numbers. This method was really fast, computing the 20899 digit 100,001st Fibonacci sequence almost instantly.

In this exercise, you are going to compute a method that returns the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number.

Examples:
```ruby
fibonacci_last(15)        # -> 0  (the 15th Fibonacci number is 610)
fibonacci_last(20)        # -> 5 (the 20th Fibonacci number is 6765)
fibonacci_last(100)       # -> 5 (the 100th Fibonacci number is 354224848179261915075)
fibonacci_last(100_001)   # -> 1 (this is a 20899 digit number)
fibonacci_last(1_000_007) # -> 3 (this is a 208989 digit number)
fibonacci_last(123456789) # -> 4

def fibonacci_last(fib_num)
  return 1 if fib_num < 2
  fib_integer = [0,1]
  count = 1
  
  loop do 
    count += 1   # 2
    break if count == fib_num   # 2 
    (fib_integer.push(fib_integer.sum)).shift
  end
  fib_integer.sum.digits.first
end

p fibonacci_last(15)        # -> 0
p fibonacci_last(20)        # -> 5
p fibonacci_last(100)       # -> 5
p fibonacci_last(100_001)   # -> 1

def fibonacci_last(nth)
  fibonacci(nth).to_s[-1].to_i
end
Part 2

def fibonacci_last(nth)
  last_2 = [1, 1]
  3.upto(nth) do
    last_2 = [last_2.last, (last_2.first + last_2.last) % 10]
  end

  last_2.last
end
Discussion
Solution 1 answers the main question in this exercise. This is almost too simple; our method simply calls the fibonacci method from our last exercises, converts the result to a string, and then returns the last digit.

However, what happens when you get into really large numbers? It probably took some time for your computer to calculate the last digit of the 1,000,007th Fibonacci number. You probably gave up trying to compute the last digit of the 123,456,789th Fibonacci number. That's where Solution 2 comes in.

Fortunately, you don't need any fancy mathematics knowledge, and you have enough Ruby experience already to solve this problem. All you have to do is reduce the problem down to its basics.

To compute the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number, you only need the last digit of the nth - 1 and nth -2 numbers. As a result, you only ever need the last digit of any intermediate result, which eliminates all of the computing effort needed to compute the massive numbers involved. Our second solution does exactly this: it only computes and uses the last digit in each intermediate result, and computes the last digit of the 123,456,789th Fibonacci number in less than a minute.
