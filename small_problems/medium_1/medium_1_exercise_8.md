The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting with 1 and 1 where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers: the 3rd Fibonacci number is 1 + 1 = 2, the 4th is 1 + 2 = 3, the 5th is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on. In mathematical terms:

F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) where n > 2
Sequences like this translate naturally as "recursive" methods. A recursive method is one in which the method calls itself. For example:

def sum(n)
  return 1 if n == 1
  n + sum(n - 1)
end
sum is a recursive method that computes the sum of all integers between 1 and n.

Recursive methods have three primary qualities:

They call themselves at least once.
They have a condition that stops the recursion (n == 1 above).
They use the result returned by themselves.
In the code above, sum calls itself once; it uses a condition of n == 1 to stop recursing; and, n + sum(n - 1) uses the return value of the recursive call to compute a new return value.

Write a recursive method that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument to the method.

This exercise is a lead-in for the next two exercises. It verges on the Advanced level, so don't worry or get discouraged if you can't do it on your own. Recursion is tricky, and even experienced developers can have trouble dealing with it.









Examples:
```ruby 
fibonacci(1) == 1
fibonacci(2) == 1
fibonacci(3) == 2
fibonacci(4) == 3
fibonacci(5) == 5
fibonacci(12) == 144
fibonacci(20) == 6765


def double_this_number (starting_number)

    # this code is executed one time:
    puts starting_number * 2 

# exit the method definition here:  
end

# call the method double_this_number
# pass in 10 as an argument
# to the parameter (starting_number)
double_this_number (10)

=> 20
=> nil

# call the double_this_number
# pass in 20 as the argument
# to the parameter starting_number
double_this_number (20)

=> 40
=> nil


def double_this_number (starting_number)
  puts starting_number * 2 
end


def my_recur (stn)
    puts stn
    if stn < 10
    my_recur (stn * 2)
    end
end

stn = 5
=> 5

if stn < 10
 
my_recur


it seems like in recurrsion one cant exist without the other.
a method cant be made to be recursive

a recursive method has to be defined

# The if statement is written as number < 2 because Fibonacci number
1 is 1 
and fibonacci number 2 is 1

def fibonacci(number)
  if number < 2
    number
  else
    fibonacci(number - 1) + fibonacci(number - 2)
  end
end

all fibbonacii number calculations are based on a rooted system that branches out
from the requested fibonacci number. t
 
The next Fib(n) is n + Previous(n)

 the fibonacci number 6 reduces to fibonacii
  5 and 4
                          6
                    5           4
               4       3       3        2
            3    2   2  1    2   1    1   0
          2  1  1 0  1 0  0   1  0   0   0
        1 0



calculating the nth fibonacci number means reversing the process of the next Fibonacci 
number




Fn 1 1
Fn 2 1
Fn 3 2

how was Fn 3 calculated
  by adding Fn 1 to  Fn 2

how can I find out what Fn 2 is from Fn 3

Fn 3 can not exist without Fn 1 or 2, so given 3, there has to be a 1 and 2

so to determine either the 1st or second Fn I can use 

Fn 3 which is 2 
Fn 1 which is 1

so Fn 2 is Fn 3 - Fn 1 


Fn 6 is 8

6 8
5 5
4 3
3 2
2 1
1 1




Fn  10 55
    9 34
    8 21
    7 13
    6 8
    5 5
    4 3
    3 2
    2 1

Fib(n) is a reduction to 1 then count the number of ones

2 -1 
2-2
0 1

Recuce to 1




subtract 1 and 2 from the Fib(n) until the last reduction is 1 and zero because 



Fib(1) is already Fib(1) so no calculation needs to be double_this_number

Find Fib(1) => 1



fib 2 is 1 as well

find the second Fib(2)

Fib3 2


The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.



The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
And the 5 is (2+3),

Discussion
The Fibonacci series is a traditional demonstration of how to use recursion. If youve learned to program elsewhere or in another language, you have probably seen this solution.

The ending condition for this method is the easiest part: we know from the description of the problem that the method should return 1 for the 1st and 2nd Fibonacci numbers, so we make that our ending condition.

The recursive part of fibonacci is unusual in that we call ourselves twice, once with nth - 1 as the argument, and again with nth - 2. We add the return values of the two calls to arrive at the nth term result.

A Diversion
This section touches on an advanced topic. You may ignore it for now but read on if you're curious.

If you've worked with recursion before, you may be familiar with something called "tail recursion." Without going into detail, tail recursion is a way to write recursive methods so the language processor can optimize it better; this often leads to faster solutions, and the ability to recurse more "deeply." The solutions are often harder to understand, though.

A tail recursive solution for this exercise is:
```ruby 

def fibonacci_tail(nth, acc1, acc2)
  if nth == 1
    acc1
  elsif nth == 2
    acc2
  else
    fibonacci_tail(nth - 1, acc2, acc2 + acc1)
  end
end

def fibonacci(nth)
  fibonacci_tail(nth, 1, 1)
end
```

This solution is much faster than our original solution and can handle much larger nth values. On the author's system, the first solution took so long to compute the 50th Fibonacci number that the author gave up. The tail-recursive method returned results for an nth value of 8000 almost instantly. It exceeded the available stack space when nth was a bit larger than 8000.

Further Exploration
We will revisit Fibonacci numbers in the next exercise, and, in particular, we will discuss some problems with our recursive solution. Before you move on, take some time to think about our solution (not the tail recursive solution). Can you identify any faults with it? Not bugs, but problems that impact its usability. How might you try to repair the issues you identify? Don't do any coding right now.
