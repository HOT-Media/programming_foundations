Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. 
And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

! is the bang operator and indicates that the method will mutate the caller
and also indicates not 

? is a boolean evaluation true or false

what is != and where should you use it? 
  to modify the caller on some methods

!= means "not equals"
? : is the ternary operator for if...else

!!<some object> is used to turn any object 
into their boolean equivalent. (Try it in irb)

!<some object> is used to turn any object into 
the opposite of their boolean equivalent, just like the above, but opposite.
