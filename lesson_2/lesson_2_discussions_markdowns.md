RPS lizard spock

Hi, here is my version of the rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock game:

[rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock](https://github.com/HOT-Media/programming_foundations/blob/master/lesson_2/rock_paper_scissors_bonus.rb "Jeremy's version")

I went with a hash in lieu of the display_result method.

I would appreciate some feeback before I get on with the r,p,s,l,s functionality.
