a method that returns the sum of two integers

START               the start of the program

GET                 retrieve input from a user

GET input_number_1
GET input_number_2


SET                 sets a variable I can use for later

SET input_number_1 = first number to add
SET input_number_2 = second number to add


READ                retrieve a value from a variable

READ input_number_1 and input_number_2
     and add them together


PRINT               display output to a user

PRINT the sum of input_number_1 and input_number_2

END                 the end of the program

and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START

SET array1 = an array of strings 


READ array1 and use a method to combine all the strings in array1



PRINT the string returned by the method 

END    



a method that takes an array of integers, 
and returns a new array with every other element

START  

SET   newarr = an empty array

READ each element of the array

WHILE iterate through the array 

IF/ELSE IF / ELSE  create a new array with every other element
using index locations 0, 1, 2
