Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizzard, Spock

Hi, here is my version of the rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock game:

[Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://github.com/HOT-Media/programming_foundations/blob/master/lesson_2/rock_paper_scissors_bonus.rb "Jeremy's version")

I went with a hash in lieu of the display_result method.

I would appreciate some feeback before I get on with the r,p,s,l,s functionality.

Thanks!
Jeremy






Hi, this is my finished program. 
What do you think about the winning_combination hash?
What other feedback do you have on the program?
